   MIASMA (McGannLab Imaging Analysis Software for Matlab)
   This directory contains archival Matlab code for wide-field imaging data analysis pipelines as used in the McGann Laboratory at Rutgers. While other iterations of MIASMA include more features, this directory contains the necessary functions to convert raw data from wide-field fluorescence imaging to response maps and fluorescence traces from user-defined regions of interest as used in Bakir et al. 2026 in Nature Communications.
   The bulk of the code was written before 2015 and is limited by the state and availability of Matlab’s toolboxes at that time, such as using GUIDE figure files instead of programmatically constructed graphical user interfaces. The code is designed to import data from RedShirtImaging camera output files, including Neuroplex files (.da) and TurboSM files (.tsm).
   For additional information about the code, please contact the McGann Lab at Rutgers.
